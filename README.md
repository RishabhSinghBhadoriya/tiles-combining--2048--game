  This is a Python implementation of the popular 2048 game using the Pygame library. In this game, the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid with tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the arrow keys. The game ends when no more moves are possible or when the player creates a tile with the number 2048.
